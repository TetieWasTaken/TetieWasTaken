## About me

### 📈 Experience

<details>
<summary>🎉 The full story</summary>

I began programming in [`Python`] around 2019. I wanted to make cool games and be an indie developer. Although it didn't go as well as I wanted, I completed my first game in late 2020 using [`PyGame`]. But ultimately decided to switch over to [`Unity`] and [`C#`] a few months later. I never really got the hang of it, so I started experimenting with [`JavaScript`]. After making some starter scripts, I decided I wanted to learn JavaScript fully and started making Discord bots with it using [`Discord.JS`]. Right now I'm learning [`TypeScript`]; it's awesome. I've also tried some [`C`] and [`C++`]. I'm looking forward to learning languages like [`Rust`] and [`Kotlin`], and learning website frameworks like [`VueJS`] in combination with [`React`] or [`Next.JS`].

### 💾 Editing videos and photography

In my free time I enjoy editing videos for all kinds of topics, but I still prefer coding. I also really enjoy making photos of nature and sometimes other interesting stuff. Although I don't do it often and being self-taught, I still think the photos are pretty cool!
