## About me

### ðŸ“ˆ Experience

I started programming around 2019, my first programming language was [`Python`](https://www.python.org/). I wanted to make cool games and be an indie developer. Although it didn't go as well as I wanted it to go. I completed my first game in late 2020 using [`PyGame`](https://www.pygame.org/). But ultimately decided to switch over to [`Unity`](https://unity.com/) and [`C#`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) a few months later. I never really got the hang of it so I started experimenting with [`JavaScript`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). After making some starter scripts I decided I wanted to learn JavaScript fully and started making discord bots with it using [`discord.js`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Right now I'm learning [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it's awesome. I've also tried some [`C`](https://www.cprogramming.com/) and [`C++`](https://cplusplus.com/). I look forward to learning languages like [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [`Kotlin`](https://kotlinlang.org/), and to learn website frameworks like [`VueJS`](https://vuejs.org/) in combination with [`React`](https://react.dev/).

### ðŸ’¾ Editing videos and photography

In my free time I enjoy editing videos for all kinds of topics, but I still prefer coding. I also really enjoy making photos of nature and sometimes other interesting stuff. Although I don't do it often and being self-taught, I still think the photos are pretty cool!
